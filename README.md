This is a repository that I've made just to store my programs for an Internship online.

This is a project I am working on for an internship. Basically I need to apply a bunch of enhancment algorithms on images.
This is probably the most challenging project I have ever attempted only because certain algorithms are very difficult to implement.
They tend to require a lot of variables to create and I need to make them work for all kinds of images, so accounting for that is a challenge and a half.

This is still a work in progress, I am only updating it here so that it can reflect in my own personal profile.

This program uses openCV and quite a lot of Image Processing. 

It's quite fun to mess around with the algorithms however the number of problems far outweigh the solutions.

To run this you will require the OpenCV library from their website, which is also pretty annoying to setup and use but once you get it to work,
the algorithms are amazing.
